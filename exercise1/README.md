# Installation of OSU Micro-Benchmarks 7.3

First of all, let's download and tar:

```bash
wget https://mvapich.cse.ohio-state.edu/download/mvapich/osu-micro-benchmarks-7.3.tar.gz
tar -xzvf osu-micro-benchmarks-7.3.tar.gz
```

Before compilation, the readme suggested to perform:

```
./configure CC=/path/to/mpicc CXX=/path/to/mpicxx
make
make install
```

In order to find such paths, we first need to load MPI module. I did:

```bash
module load openMPI/4.1.5/gnu
```

Then, we can find such paths by doing:

```bash
which mpicc  #this returned /opt/programs/openMPI/4.1.5/bin/mpicc
which mpicxx #this returned /opt/programs/openMPI/4.1.5/bin/mpicxx 
```

Now we can do:

```bash
cd osu-micro-benchmarks-7.3
./configure CC=/opt/programs/openMPI/4.1.5/bin/mpicc CXX=/opt/programs/openMPI/4.1.5/bin/mpicxx
make
make install
```
