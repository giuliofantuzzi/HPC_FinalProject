# Exercise 2a

Implementation of the broadcast algorithm both in distributed memory and in shared memory

- Distributed memory implementation with an MPI code using *point-to-point* calls ONLY
- Shared memory implementation with an OpenMP code

**Note** : for distributed memory implementation I can also implement a hybrid code...think about it
